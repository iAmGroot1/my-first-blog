# Created a blog 
This is my attempt at building a blog using Django. As this is my first project using Django its not very robust. It lacks some 
basic functionality such as displaying the comments which i am trying to implement. I am using **pythonanywhere.com** as my host. 

I started learning Django from a tutorial called **Django girls tutorial** a link for which is given below. This tutorial 
gives you an introduction from the very basic and is amazing for getting a quick start to Django. 

Any feedback on the website would be appericiated :smile:
